# Modelling_RbYb_PECs
We model spin-free electrostatic potential energy curves (PECs) of RbYb from published spin-orbit (SO) coupled PECs.
The published SO-PECs are taken from Fig. 1 of Comput. Theo. Chem. 1103, 11 (2017). We want to obtain spin-free curves similar to Fig. 1 of Phys. Rev. A 88, 020701(R) (2013).
Once spin-free PECs are obtained we will perfrom ultracold scattering calculations to understand its Feshbach resonances.
